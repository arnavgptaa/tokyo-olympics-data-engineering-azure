# Tokyo Olympics Data Analysis Project - Data Engineering

# Overview

This project aims to securely manage, streamline, and perform analysis on structured and semi-structured Tokyo Olympics data based on various sports, events, and athlete performances, etc. The data engineering pipeline is built using Microsoft Azure and leverages various services and tools to achieve the project goals.

# Project Goals
1. Data Ingestion: Implement a mechanism to ingest data from different sources such as official Olympic records about the players and their dynamics.
2. ETL System: Transform raw data into the proper format for analysis, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
3. Data Lake: Create a centralized repository to store data from multiple sources, enabling historical and real-time analysis.
Scalability: Ensure the system scales with increasing data size and the dynamic nature of the Olympics.
4. Cloud: Utilize Microsoft Azure for processing vast amounts of data and handling peak event loads.
5. Reporting: Build a dashboard to answer key questions about the Tokyo Olympics, including medal standings, athlete performances, and event outcomes.

# Services and Tools Used:

1. Microsoft Azure: The cloud platform used for hosting and managing various components of the project.
2. Azure Data Factory Pipeline: Used to orchestrate and automate data workflows, including data ingestion and ETL processes.
3. Azure Storage Account: Provides scalable and secure storage for the raw and transformed data.
4. Azure Synapse Analytics: Used for data warehousing and analytics to perform complex queries and analysis.
5. Azure Data Lake Gen 2: Serves as a centralized data lake for storing structured and semi-structured data.
6. Azure Databricks: Provides a collaborative environment for big data and machine learning tasks.

Kaggle Dataset: The source of data containing statistics on Tokyo Olympics events, athletes, and results.

# Dataset Used

The project utilizes a Kaggle dataset that contains comprehensive data on the Tokyo Olympics, including information about sports, events, athletes, medal standings, and event outcomes. This dataset is a valuable source for performing in-depth analysis of the Olympics.
